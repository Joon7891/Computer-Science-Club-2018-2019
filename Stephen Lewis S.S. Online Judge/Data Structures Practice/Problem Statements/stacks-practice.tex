Joon7891 is practicing data structures. He comes across the following stacks problem:

You initially have a stack of $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 1000$) elements. There are $M$ ($1 \leq M \leq 100000$) operations you need to perform on it.

Each operation is one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $I$ $x$ - insert an element of value $x$ onto the top of the stack
    \item $R$ - remove the element on top of the stack
    \item $T$ - output the element on top of the stack
    \item $P$ - remove and output the element on top of the stack
    \item $N$ - output the number of elements in the stack
\end{itemize}

It is guaranteed that all elements in the array will be between $âˆ’10^9$ and $10^9$ (inclusive).

\inputformat
The first line of input will contain integers $N$ and $M$.

The second line of input will have $N$ integers. The first element will be at the bottom of the stack, whereas the last element will be at the top of the stack.

The next $M$ lines will have an operation in the format described above.

\outputformat
For each $T, P,$ or $N$ operation, output the answer on its own line.
