\section*{J4 - Cubic Sums}
George is learning about exponents and sums today in his Grade 9 math class. One particular combination of exponents and sums that have captivated George's attention are $a$-$b$ cubic sums. An $a$-$b$ cubic sum is calculated as the sum of all cubes of integers between $a$ and $b$, inclusive.

To help compute $a$-$b$ cubic sums quickly, George has attempted to create a program to do the calculations for him. However, it either gives him the wrong answer, takes too much time, or takes up too much memory. Will you show him a working example?

\inputformat
The first and only line of input will consist of two integers $a$ and $b$.

\constraints
For all subtasks, $1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9$

\textbf{Subtask 1 [10\%]} \\
$|a - b| \leq 10^6$ \\

\textbf{Subtask 2 [20\%]} \\
$|a - b| \leq 10^9$

\outputformat
Output the corresponding $a$-$b$ cubic sum modulus $10^9 + 7$.
