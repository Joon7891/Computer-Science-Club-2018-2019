\section*{S5 - Illiteracy}
Horatio and his friends are playing a new game called Illiteracy, The game, like Scrabble, consists of a two-dimensional grid where players score points by placing single letter tiles onto the grid; however, unlike Scrabble, the score of a word $W$ is the maximum string value for all the substrings in $W$. The value of a string $s$ is the product of the length of s and the number of times $s$ occurred in $W$, defined as $V(s) = |s| \cdot O(s,W)$ where $O(s,W)$ represents the number of occurrences of $s$ in $W$.

Given a word $W$, help Horatio determine the score of the word.

\inputformat
The first and only line of input consists of a single string describing the word $W$.

\constraints
The output consists of a single integer, the score of $W$
