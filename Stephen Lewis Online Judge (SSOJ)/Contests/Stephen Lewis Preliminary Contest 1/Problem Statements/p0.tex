\section{$\boldsymbol{A}$ to the $\boldsymbol{B}$}
In math class, Greg is learning about radical functions and their inverse. In order to sharpen his mathematical rigour, he has decided to exercise his computational skills by determining $A$ to the $B$; however, he quickly realizes that this problem is much too difficult. Thus, he needs your help to determine $A$ to the $B$. Rescue Greg from mathematical damnation!

\inputformat
The first line of input will contain an integer $t$ denoting the number of computations Greg needs to do. The next t lines contain two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$.

\outputformat
For each computation, output the value of $A^{B}$
