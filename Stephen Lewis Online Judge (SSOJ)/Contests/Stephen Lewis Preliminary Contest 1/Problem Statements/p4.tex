\section{Every Mother's Nightmare}
Every year, in the weeks leading up to the holidays, mothers around the world take on the difficult task of buying their children gifts in order to keep them satisfied for the holidays. One particular mother has $K$ dollars, and walks into a store with $N$ gifts, each with a cost of $c$ and a satisfaction amount of $s$. She wants to ensure that she maximizes the combined satisfaction of her gifts, without spending more than $K$ dollars. Determine the maximum amount of combined satisfaction possible.

\inputformat
The first line of input will contain two integers $K$, and $N$. The next $N$ lines will contain $c_i$, and $s_i$, the cost and satisfaction amount of gift $i$.

\constraints
For all subtasks, $1 \leq c_i \leq 10^5$ and $-10^5 \leq s_i \leq 10^5$.

\textbf{Subtask 1 [20\%]} \\
$1 \leq N \leq 100$ \\
$1 \leq K \leq 100$

\textbf{Subtask 2 [80\%]} \\
$1 \leq N \leq 5,000$ \\
$1 \leq K \leq 5,000$
